    <p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
         <p>A <b>document</b> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
         <p><b>Presenting</b> a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>
       <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:</p>
<ul>        
<li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
<li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>
         </ul>       
         <p>A set of CSS rules contained within a <b>stylesheet</b> determines how a webpage should look. You will learn a lot more about what CSS syntax looks like in the next article of the module — CSS Syntax.</p>

  <article>
    <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Properties</b>: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g. font, width, background color) you want to change.</li>
    <li><b>Values</b>: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g. what you want to change the font, width or background color to.)</li>
    </ul>   
<p>A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).</p>
    <p>Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style it. What is important to remember is that both properties and values are case-sensitive in CSS. The property and value in each pair is separated by a colon (:).</p>

    <p>We are missing one part of the puzzle — we need to discuss how to tell our declaration blocks which elements they should be applied to. This is done by prefixing each declaration block with a <b>selector</b> — a pattern that matches some elements on the page. The associated declarations will be applied to those elements only. The selector plus the declaration block is called a <b>ruleset</b>, or often simply just a <b>rule</b>.</p>

         <article>
         <p>In the last article we explained general CSS syntax and terminology in detail. To recap, selectors are one part of a CSS rule and come just before CSS declaration blocks.</p>
           <ul>
           <li><b>Simple selectors</b>: Match one or more elements based on element type, class, or id.</li>
           <li><b>Attribute selectors</b>: Match one or more elements based on their attributes/attribute values.</li>
           <li><b>Pseudo-classes</b>: Match one or more elements that exist in a certain state, such as an element that is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox that is currently disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</li>
<li><b>Pseudo-elements</b>: Match one or more parts of content that are in a certain position in relation to an element, for example the first word of each paragraph, or generated content appearing just before an element.</li>
<li><b>Combinators</b>: These are not exactly selectors themselves, but ways of combining two or more selectors in useful ways for very specific selections. So for example, you could select only paragraphs that are direct descendants of divs, or paragraphs that come directly after headings.</li>
<li><b>Multiple selectors</b>: Again, these are not separate selectors; the idea is that you can put multiple selectors on the same CSS rule, separated by commas, to apply a single set of declarations to all the elements selected by those selectors.</li>     </ul>

         <header>Simple Selectors</header>
         <p><b>Element Selectors</b>: This selector is just a case-insensitive match between the selector name and a given HTML element name. This is the simplest way to target all elements of a given type. Let's take a look at an example:</p>
         <code>/* All p elements are red */
p {
  color: red;
           }</code>
         <p><b>Class Selectors</b>:The class selector consists of a dot, '.', followed by a class name. A class name is any value, without spaces, placed within an HTML class attribute. It is up to you to choose a name for the class. It is also noteworthy that multiple elements in a document can have the same class value, and a single element can have multiple class names separated by white space. Here's a quick example:<p>
           <code>/* The element with the class "first" is bolded */
.first {
  font-weight: bold;
}
 </code>
         <p><b>ID Selectors</b>: The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (#), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any element can have a unique ID name set with the id attribute. It is up to you to choose an ID name. It's the most efficient way to select a single element.</p>
         <code>#polite {
  font-family: cursive;
           }</code>
         <p><b>Universal Selector</b>: The universal selector (*) is the ultimate joker. It allows selecting all elements in a page. As it is rarely used to apply a style to every element on a page, it is often used in combination with other selectors (see Combinators.)</p>
         <code>* {
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  background: rgba(255,0,0,0.25)
           }</code>

      <!-- Attribute Selectors -->

         <header>Attribute Selectors</header>
         <article>
           <p>Attribute selectors are a special kind of selector that will match elements based on their attributes and attribute values. Their generic syntax consists of square brackets ([]) containing an attribute name followed by an optional condition to match against the value of the attribute. Attribute selectors can be divided into two categories depending on the way they match attribute values: <b>Presence and value</b> attribute selectors and <b>Substring value</b> attribute selectors.</p>
           <h4><b>Presence and value attribute selectors</b></h4>
           
             <p>These attribute selectors try to match an exact attribute value:</p>
           <ul>
           <li>[attr] : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, whatever its value.</li>
          <li>[attr=val] : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, but only if its value is val.</li> 
     <li>[attr~=val]: This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, but only if  val is one of a space-separated list of words contained in attr's value. </li>
           </ul>
           <code>/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable"
   are given green text */
[data-vegetable] {
  color: green;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable"
   with the exact value "liquid" are given a golden
   background color */
[data-vegetable="liquid"] {
  background-color: goldenrod;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable",
   containing the value "spicy", even among others,
   are given a red text color */
[data-vegetable~="spicy"] {
  color: red;
             }</code>
           <h4><b>Substring value attribute selectors</b></h4>
           <p>Attribute selectors in this class are also known as "RegExp-like selectors", because they offer flexible matching in a similar fashion to regular expression (but to be clear, these selectors are not true regular expression):</p>
           <ul>
          <li>[attr|=val] : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value is exactly val or starts with val- (careful, the dash here isn't a mistake, this is to handle language codes.)</li>
           <li>[attr^=val] : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value starts with val.</li>
           <li>[attr$=val] : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value ends with val.</li>
           <li>[attr*=val] : This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value contains the substring val. (A substring is simply part of a string, e.g. "cat" is a substring in the string "caterpillar".) </li>
           </ul>
           <code>/* Classic usage for language selection */
[lang|="fr"] {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-quantity", for which
   the value starts with "optional" */
[data-quantity^="optional"] {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-quantity", for which
   the value ends with "kg" */
[data-quantity$="kg"] {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable" containing
   the substring "not spicy" are turned back to green */
[data-vegetable*="not spicy"] {
  color: green; }</code>

         <header>Pseudo Classes & Elements</header>
         <article>
           <h4>Pseudo-classes</h4>
           <p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon (:), which is used to specify that you want to style the selected element but only when it is in a certain state. For example, you might want to style a link element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</p>
           <p>We will not dig into every pseudo-class right now, it is not the objective of the Learning Area to teach you everything in exhaustive detail. You'll certainly come across some of these in more detail later, where appropriate.</p>
           <code>/* We want visited links to be the same color
   as non visited links */
a:visited {
  color: blue;
}

/* We highlight the link when it is
   hovered (mouse), activated
   or focused (keyboard) */
a:hover,
a:active,
a:focus {
  color: darkred;
  text-decoration: none;
             }</code>
           <h4>Pseudo-elements</h4>
           <p>Pseudo-elements are very much like pseudo-classes, but they have differences. They are keywords, this time preceded by two colons (::), that can be added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of an element.</p>
           <ul>
           <li>::after</li>
           <li>::before</li>
           <li>::first-letter</li>
           <li>::first-line</li>
           <li>::selection</li>
           <li>::backdrop</li>
           </ul>
           <p>They all have some very specific behaviors and interesting features, but digging into them all in detail is beyond our scope for now.</p>

         <header>Combinators & Groups of Selectors</header>
         <article>
           <p>Using one selector at a time is useful, but can be inefficient in some situations. CSS selectors become even more useful when you start combining them to perform fine-grained selections. CSS has several ways to select elements based on how they are related to one another. Those relationships are expressed with combinators as follows (A and B represent any selector seen above):</p>
           <ul>
           <li>	A, B  Any element matching A and/or B (see Groups of selectors on one rule, below - Group of Selectors is not considered to be a combinator).</li>
           <li>	A > B  Any element matching B that is a direct child of an element matching A.</li>
           <li>A + B  Any element matching B that is the next sibling of an element matching A (that is, the next child of the same parent).</li>
           <li>A ~ B  Any element matching B that is one of the next siblings of an element matching A (that is, one of the next children of the same parent).</li>
           </ul>
